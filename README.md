# Python_db
Creating a Database.
Python has many libraries that can be used to connect to SQL database such as MYSQLdb, pyodbc etc. But In this project, I used SQLAlchemy, a library that makes it pretty easy to connect to SQL/ORM database in python. I used it with SQLite. Note that SQLAchemy can be used with other database engines such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
